Hello,

My name is Brent and I am 43 years old. I was born in Seattle in 1976. I grew up in a suburb of Seattle called Federal Way.
I was a good student and always did well in school. I was the winner of the first grade spelling bee at my school. I was a Cub
Scout for a time through my church and I was a member of the Young Astronauts Club. We played with model rocketry and did computer
science experiments. I was in an accelerated learning program. I loved to read, listen to music, and watch TV. I used to watch mostly
PBS. I used to love going to the library. There was a magazine there called 'Electric Company' based on the children's educational show
of the same name. In the back pages there were always about 3 or 4 reader submitted programs in BASIC and I would ask the libarian
kindly to make Xerox copies of those pages and I would take them home and enter them into my TRS-80 Model III (and later a Tandy 1000)
and I would figure out how to improve the programs by making them work better or adding some kinds of improvements. I used to love playing
text based adventure games. My favorites were Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Police Quest, Day of the Tentacle, and Monkey Island.
When I was in 5th grade, my school had a 'Self-Esteem' week that ended in a balloon release by the whole school out in the soccer field.
My balloon went all the way to South Dakota and I was in the local Federal Way paper about it.

Cheers,
Brent
